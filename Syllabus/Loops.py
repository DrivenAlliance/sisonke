#Loops in Programming are blocks of code that repeat until a certain conditions has been met. Different types of loops have different types of conditions.


# For Loop
# - There are 2 main kinds of for loops, one that executes a certain number of times (a range of values) and one that executes for every item in a list
#   - Execute for a range: for current_index in range(0, 10):
#   - We use the range function to be able to go through a range of items, the first item is the start number, the second is the end and the last (optional) is the number to increment or decrement
#   - Execute for every item in a loop: for current_item in list:

# While Loop
# While a certain condition is true, continue the while loop
# - while (raw_input("Continue(Y or N)?: ") == "Y"):

# For loops can also be nested in each other, for example to use one for loop to search in another for loop.
