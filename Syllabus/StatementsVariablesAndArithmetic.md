Statements Are the smallest standalone part of a programming language. It's an instruction to the computer to perform a certain action. 

The following are examples of statements: (taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)))

#Simple statements:
-assignment: name = "Sisonke Rising"
-return: return 5
-call a function: print(name)

#Compound statements:
-[for-loop](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex32.html): for x in range(1,3):
-[if-statement](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex30.html): if name == "Sisonke Rising":
-[while-loop](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex33.html): while i < 10:

#Work:
###a. The purpose of this exercise is to show you how to add numbers together and store the value in a variable (assignment)
1. Ask the person next to you how old they are and add it to yours and assign it to sum_of_our_ages
2. Ask someone else and add that to sum_of_our_ages in a different statement (remember, don't lose the previous ages)

###b. The purpose of this exercise is to show you how to read input from the user, and assign it to a variable. Then also how to use it in another statement
1. Ask the user to give them your name and assign it to a variable
2. print "Hello [their name]"

###c The purpose of this exercise is to show you how to call functions.
1. Create a list with three of your friend's names
2. sort that list by calling the sorted function
3. Show the sorted list on the screen by calling the print function without using variables

###d The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use a return value from a called function
1. Call the random.randint (remember to import random first) function and assign the return value to a variable called first_lottery_number, with a the minimum number = 1 and maximum = 49
2. create another random number the same as above and assign it to a new variable called second_lottery_number
3. print ("The winning lotto numbers are: ") using the variables in d.1. and d.2.
